### Data Cleanup 
Three biggest files we worked with were NYPD Arrest Data Year to Date(2019 extraction),NYPD Arrest Data Historic(2020 extraction) and NYPD Hospitalization Counts. Since we only needed two specific years, we were able to extract those years and work with much smaller files for our analysis.

### Radar Chart
After observing some movement in top 15 crime analysis, we wanted to see if there is an overall change across all crimes and how big of a change, if any.

Focusing in on age groups of 18-24 and 25-44, assault, drugs and larceny were most common crimes of both age groups. However, there is a huge increase in 25-44 age group in year 2019.
