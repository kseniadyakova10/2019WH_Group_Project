### Data Cleanup 
Using Kaggle, we obtained 5 CSV files with information regarding each countires happiness score based of 6 factors:
* life expectancy
* economics
* absence of corruption
* freedom
* generocity

To make analysis easier to read, we were able to make edits in datasets that would be consistent for MongoDB import.

After connecting to MongoDB and inserting our data, we created a Flask app in order to run and use our data for our Javascript visualizations.
